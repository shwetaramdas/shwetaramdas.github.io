I conduct "Resilience Workshops" for undergraduate students at Azim Premji University. Here are some resources I use for these. 

### Resilience (or bouncing back)
1. Emotional resilience can be developed by:
    Recognizing the fact that our thoughts influence our actions
    Acknowledging stress and be willing to effectively cope with it
    Being open to changes and flexible while adapting to new situations
    Accepting the truth that by changing the way we react to stress, a lot of difference can be made
    Embracing the self by building self-compassion and empathy

### Wellness
1. Breathing. These exercises can simulate the relaxation response in the body. A five-minute breathing meditation to bring some calm. [Great meditation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94Dh8TbctwY)
2. 

### Cognitive Skills
1. How we respond to adversity depends on a set of underlying beliefs that we don't recognize. Some of these are called [cognitive distortions]('https://www.verywellmind.com/ten-cognitive-distortions-identified-in-cbt-22412'). Recognizing these thought patterns can help us respond to situations more intentionally.
2. The ABCD model. Adversity-Beliefs-Consequences-Disputation. (https://www.bjclearn.org/resiliency/PDFs/044109.pdf). These worksheets help us respond to stressful situations rationally not emotionally.
