Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor at the [Center for Brain Research](https://cbr.iisc.ac.in/), Indian Institute of Science. I specialize in human genetics and genomics, epigenetics, and bioinformatics. 

I earned my Ph.D in Bioinformatics and an M.A. applied statistics working in the [Li lab](junzli.com/) at  the [University of Michigan](https://www.umich.edu/) and my B.S. in Computational Biology from the [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/). I did my postdoctoral work in the [Brown lab](https://www.med.upenn.edu/brownlab/) at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu).

My [research](research) explores genetic variation in human populations (with a focus on Indian populations) and its role in regulating gene expression and a host of complex traits. I primarily use bioinformatic and statistical approaches to answer these questions. I'm also interested in mining publicly-available data to ask novel biological questions. 

I [have taught](teaching) undergradute and graduate courses on genomics, genetics, quantitative biology, R programming, and scientific writing.
