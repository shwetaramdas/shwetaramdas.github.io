Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor at the School of Arts and Sciences at 
[Azim Premji University](https://apu.edu.in/). I specialize
in human genetics, epigenetics, and bioinformatics. 

I earned my Ph.D in Bioinformatics and an M.A. applied statistics in  from the
[University of Michigan](https://www.umich.edu/) and my
B.S. in Computational Biology from the [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/). I did my postdoctoral work in the Brown lab at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu).

My [research](research) explores genetic variation in human populations and its role in regulating gene expression, and a host of traits. I primarily use bioinformatic and statistical approaches to answer these questions. 

I [teach](teaching) courses on genomics, human genetics, R programming.
