### Expectations for research students who work with me

1. Record all your work. Reproducibility is of primary importance in computational biology. When you revisit an analysis six months later (something which will definitely happen), you should be able to figure out what you did. You can use Benchling as an electronic lab notebook.
2. Read the literature. Being aware of other studies is an important part of the scientific process. I expect students to read at least two papers a week.
3. Meet with me at least once a week.
4. Write a weekly report on your progress/work over the previous week. This doesn’t have to be very long, this is a way to reflect on the previous week’s work, plan for the next week, and organize your data. It’s okay not to have gotten anything to work the previous week.
5. Take ownership: Your project is yours, and you will be co-leading it *with* me. I expect students to 
6. Integrity: In science, we do not look for a particular result. We report what we see, even if it is a ‘disappointing’ result.
7. Work collaboratively. The best part of an academic environment is the ability to learn from each other. The best scientific ideas often arise from conversations over coffee. I expect members of the group to support each other and take the time to learn about each others’ work. 

### What students can expect from me (inspired by [Ziyue Gao](https://sites.google.com/view/gaolab/join-us?authuser=0))

- I will provide rigorous training in statistics, bioinformatics and human genomics
- I will work with you to help you identify a question that drives you
- I will help you develop your writing, presenting, and leadership skills (a key both in academia and outside academia).
- I will meet with you weekly to troubleshoot, prioritize next steps, and help keep projects moving.
- I will help move your project from the first draft to a paper/conference presentation
- I will be supportive of your career goals and will work with you to find the best ways to reach them.
