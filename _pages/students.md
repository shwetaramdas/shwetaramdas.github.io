### Expectations for research students

1. Record all your work. Reproducibility is of primary importance in computational biology. When you revisit an analysis six months later (something which will definitely happen), you should be able to figure out what you did. You can use Benchling as an electronic lab notebook.
2. Read the literature. Being aware of other studies is an important part of the scientific process. I expect students to read at least one paper a week.
3. Meet with me at least once a week.
4. Write a weekly report on your progress/work over the previous week. This doesn’t have to be very long, this is a way to reflect on the previous week’s work, plan for the next week, and organize your data. It’s okay not to have gotten anything to work the previous week.
5. Take ownership: Your project is yours, and you will be co-leading it *with* me.
6. Integrity: In science, we do not look for a particular result. We report what we see, even if it is a ‘disappointing’ result.
7. Work collaboratively. The best part of an academic environment is the ability to learn from each other. The best scientific ideas often arise from conversations over coffee. I expect members of the group to support each other and take the time to learn about each others’ work.
