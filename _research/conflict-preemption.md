In this branch of my research, I work with a large pedigree from a founder population (the Amish population) to find regulatory variants of large effect that are enriched in such populations. I integrate DNA-seq and RNA-seq data to identify variants with potentially large functional consequences. 

This work was presented as a talk at the Biology of Genomes in 2020. 

I'm interested in extending my research on founder populations to family-based and population-based studies in India.
