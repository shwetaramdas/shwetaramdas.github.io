In this set of projects, I integrate information from GWAS with epigenomic data to prioritize causal genes, and get closer to understanding mechanisms through which these genetic loci influence complex traits. I primarily use eQTLs, chromatin interaction, in silico prediction methods, ChIP-Seq data to prioritize GWAS loci and find patterns of enrichment at these loci. 

Our work in this domain was recently published/pre-printed:
