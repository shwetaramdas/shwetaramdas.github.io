### Paper 1: Large-scale integration of the plasma proteome with genetics and disease. Ferkingstad et al 2021. 
A huge pQTL association gives us 1) a valuable new dataset to identify disease-associated genes by adding in protein expression levels into the mix with gene expression levels. 2) Gives an insight that could be useful: tissue-specific genes can be identified even in a tissue like blood when measuring pQTLs (proteins move between tissues).
